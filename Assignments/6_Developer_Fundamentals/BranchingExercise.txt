1. git checkout -b "BRANCH NAME" 
2. fast forward merge simply moves the head of master to that of the new branch, this is possible as there are no new commits on master. 
   With recursive merge multiple commits have to merged so git adds the commits of branch together before doing a comparison
3. git checkout "BRANCH NAME"
4. git branch -D "BRANCH NAME"
5. when changes to the repo are more complicated than the additions or omission of lines, git asks the user which set of changes should overwrite the other.
